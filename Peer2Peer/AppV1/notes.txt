Given:

We are making a content sharing application, like a torrenting application.

The application utilizes an index server which "indexes" all live content servers, and makes their addresses available for peers such that they can connect to each other for file download.


Requirements:
- clients will connect to the index server via UDP
- clients will connect to each other via TCP
- content available for download is listed by the index server
- when a client downloads content, that content is now available for download by another client.
	- index server should organize based on content, and then which servers have the specified content.


PDU specification:
R - Content Registration, Content Server -> Index server (size: 100)
D - Content Download Request, Client -> Content Server (size:100)
S - Search for content and associated server, Peer -> Index server
T - Content De-Registration, Peer -> Index server
C - Content Data, Peer -> Index Server
O - List of active content, Peer -> Index server
A - Ack
E - Error

Error Codes:
    1 : exit
    2 : lost packet / failed last command
    3 : could not find content

PDU data format :

(client to index_server):
    R : port;addr;filename(25)
    S : filename(25)
    T : port;addr;filename(25)
    D : filename(25)
    O : " "
    A : message(optional)
    E : error_code(optional)

(index_server to client):
    R : (recv R return A or E)
    S : port;addr;filename(25) or E (code 3)
    T : (recv T return A or E)
    O : (multi step recv)   1 - num_servers;
                            2 - addr;port;num_packets
                            n - 1 - packet_id;list( 4 list elements )
                            last - go to 2 until total content list = num_servers
    D : addr;port or E

(client to download):
    C : filename(25)
    E : error_code(optional)
    A : message(optional)

(download to client):
    C : (multi step recv)   1 - num_packets;
                            2 - packet_id;content(max_len);
    E : error_code(optional);
    A : message(optional);

Components:
Index Server:
	- Hosts available content
	- Hosts available clients
	- Multi-connection/Multi-threaded
	
Peer
	Client:
		- Communicates with index server
		- Communicates with content client
		- Only one connection at a time
		
	Content Server:
		- send content list to index server
		- send content to peer
		- unlist content at index server


Done:
 - sending from download_client to index_server
 - most functions have been tested

To-Do:
    - 1 send, 1 recv from client to server
    - list some bs
    - search some bs
    - content_server hosting so search works proper
